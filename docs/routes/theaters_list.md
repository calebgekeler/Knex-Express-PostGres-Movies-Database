## Get all theaters

This route will return a list of all theaters. Different query parameters will allow for additional information to be included in the data that is returned.

There is one case to consider:

- `GET /theaters`

### GET /theaters

Create a route that responds to the following request:

```
GET /theaters
```

This route should return all the `theaters` and, the movies playing at each theatre added to the `movies` key. This means you will need to check the `movies_theaters` table.

The response from the server should look like the following.

```json
